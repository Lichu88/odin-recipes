    Breakfast Egg Bites (Base Recipe)
Prep: 5 mins
Cook: 30 mins
Total: 35 mins
Servings: 12
Yield: 12 mini egg cups
Ingredients

Nonstick pan spray
12 large eggs
1/3 cup milk (whole, skim, or 2%)
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
Directions

Set a rack in the top third of the oven and preheat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Generously spray the wells of a 12-cup standard muffin tin with nonstick pan spray.
Crack the eggs into a large bowl and add the milk, salt, and pepper. Whisk until the mixture is homogeneous and there are no streaks of unincorporated egg whites.
Evenly distribute the mixture into the wells of the muffin tin filling them about three-fours of the way to the top (about 1/4 cup per well). Bake until the egg bites puff up and the tops no longer look wet, 25 to 30 minutes. (The egg bites will puff dramatically in the oven but collapse once cooled.)
Let cool slightly, then remove the egg bites from the tin using an offset spatula or butter knife. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.
